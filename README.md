# MuseumHeist
    The name of our project is MuseumHeist! 
    Our project, MuseumHeist, is a game in which users will be able to play using their keyboard. They will use the letters W, A, S, D to move. The user will essentially spawn at the beginning of a maze as a circle and have to move their way through to get to the key. Additionally, there will be a timer countdown indicating how much time they have to complete the maze. If the timer runs out, then they will start over.
